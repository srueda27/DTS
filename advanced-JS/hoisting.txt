Variables are partially hoisted     ----> only work with var 
Functions declaration are hoisted   ----> only work with function 

console.log('something')
console.log(teddy) --> here teddy is undefined because variables are partially hoisted
sing() --> it wouldn't be an issue because functions are hoisted

var teddy = 'oli'
function sing() {
  console.log('sign')
}
